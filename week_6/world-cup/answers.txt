Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
It was more or less the same teams, who were reprecented in the top in all simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I would accept the predictions from the 1000 simulations, because there is no difference from that one and the following predictions.
